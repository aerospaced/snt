Here is the project file for Backend Coding Challenge.

My laptop crashed on installing Laravel, It is on the laptop but not running.
Saturday night, I gave up on Laravel 5 and just decided to do the Challenge with just
PHP and MySQL.  Finished sunday night.

On this project, there was no date on the listing I received, I thought about using the attributes on the photos
but not all listings had photos, so that would not work.

Since I could not get Laravel to work, the timer function would be moot.  I could cheat and create a CRON job on the linux server
but that is not what you were wanting.  Node.js would be another tool.  Or a resident web browser open with an endless loop watching 
the time in javascript.  

I ran out of time on the endpoint toggle, but what I had planned was to call with "mode=toggle&mlsno=12777"

IN the directorys, the include holds the sqlconnect file which sets constants used in the program, and css info for index page
and in the screenoutputJSON shows the JSON ouputs and the url which called it. and the DDL is the dump from MYSQL.

IMPORTANT!!!!!----->  I HAVE WINDOWS IIS RUNNING.  WAMP SERVER  IS ON PORT 81   !!!!!!!<<-------------
